                "I know who the MVP of tonight was for sure - absolutely, without a doubt, and you should've seen our dressing room after the game. Man, that was the most juice I've seen in our dressing room in a long time. It was a pretty special night," Oilers head coach Jay Woodcroft said.

                Everyone in attendance at Rogers Place gave Ben a standing ovation as they left the venue, confident that the little guy will come out on top in the most important game of his life, fighting for his life.

                The boy was diagnosed with a brain tumor when he was just four years old. Since then he has undergone four rounds of chemotherapy and 40 radiotherapy sessions to remove it, but in December the tumor returned, so he will undergo more rounds of radiotherapy. Ben is a warrior who was also voted the most important player of the game.

                “As many as 57 students fell ill after having their mid-day meal. They complained of vomiting and abdominal pain, and were rushed to a nearby hospital,” LS Paraste, a teacher at the Government Middle School in Keolari under Samnapur block, said.
                Nearly 57 children on Tuesday fell sick after eating their mid-day meal in a government school in Dindori in Madhya Pradesh, an official told news agency PTI. A teacher of the school said that a girl student spotted a lizard in the lentils on her plate while having mid-day meal
                On the other hand, health department official Vikram Singh said all the children are out of danger and currently under observation of doctors.

                "Our findings suggest that for patients with severe COVID, the decision to withdraw life support shouldn't be based solely on prolonged periods of unconsciousness, as these patients may eventually recover," Dr. Jan Claassen of New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in statement. "These findings provide us with more accurate information to guide families who are deciding whether to continue life-sustaining therapy in unconscious COVID-19 patients," Classen's colleague, Dr. Brian Edlow of the Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a statement.

                They reviewed data on 795 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 at three medical centers during the first two surges of the pandemic. All were on mechanical ventilation for at least six days, during which they were comatose. After removal from respiratory support, 72% eventually regained consciousness, but 25% of them needed at least 10 days to wake up, and 10% needed 23 days or more to recover.

                  A long-awaited report into the harm and deaths of more than 1,800 mothers and babies at a Midlands hospital trust is set to be published on Wednesday. Midlands Correspondent Ben Chapman met a mother who lost one baby and feared she could lose her second.
                  It is an incomprehensible number, but for 1,862 families, Wednesday will be both a long-awaited, and distressing day.

                  The Sabbath is surrounded by an aura of holiness, which is basically a setting apart for God. This day is to be kept “holy” because God “blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy” (Ex 20:11). Faithful to his people’s belief and tradition, Jesus respects the Sabbath. But he asserts that it has to yield to the satisfaction of human needs. Elsewhere he says, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath” (Mk 2:27). For Jesus, the law of the Sabbath and all other laws should serve a human being’s full development and should make life more pleasant, a human being more “refreshed.” The paralytic who had been ill for 38 years finds a new lease and refreshment in life because of what Jesus does on the Sabbath.

                  Commissioner George Erwin M. Garcia backed this statement of Jimenez and noted that sometimes the certifications from the Civil Registry are being sent late to the poll body.

                  “Minsan po talaga hindi natatanggal kaya natatanong po lagi ‘yan, pero ang dahilan, minsan po ay kasalanan din ng mga civil registrar kasi under the law, under RA 8189 kinakailangan po kasi na ang Comelec ay mabigyan ng certification ng listahan kung ilan namatay sa quarter na ‘yun (Sometimes, the names of the dead voters are not removed from the list that’s why it’s always being asked, but the reason is that, sometimes it is the fault of the civil registrar because under RA 8189, Comelec must be provided with a certification of the list of the number of deceased individuals that quarter),” he said during an ambush interview with reporters on Tuesday, March 29.

                  The Victorian boys both suffer from Cerebral Palsy (CP). While Jaxson is "high muscle tone" and prone to stiffness, Jayden is "low muscle tone", has epilepsy and tube fed straight into his stomach.

                  Where Jaxson is stiff, Jayden is limp.

                  "Physically, they really are polar opposites. Jaxson has always been verbal, but Jayden only has a few words and is non-verbal," Rebecca explains.

                  The third annual Drunk Driving Awareness will be from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. April 30 at Veterans Park. Mothers Against Drunk Driving will be there, along with a live band, prize raffles and the purposeful walk of the “Memory Mile.”

                    A food truck will be available to sell breakfast foods, such as donuts and coffee. Special event T-shirts will be available online and available for purchase and registration for $20. Funds raised from the event will go toward the Cañon City and Florence High schools and their upcoming fun fest events.

                    “I give money to them (CCHS and FHS schools) to help because they’re trying to keep seniors safe the night before their graduation so they’re not out partying,” said Pamela Hamby, organizer of the awareness event.

                    On April 13, 2018, a devastating loss was suffered when Brieonna Sanders-Samora was killed by a drunken driver. Hamby, Sanders-Samora’s mother, dove into efforts to organize ways to keep her memory alive — and educate the community in the process.

                    So, on Dec. 11, 2020, Kendall Jurnakins was born at 25 weeks. He weighed just 15 ounces. His doctor estimated his chance of surviving at the time was close to 50-50.

      “When he was born at 25 weeks and based on his weight, national data and international [data], his chance to survive was around like 50 to 60% … this is only survival, not survival with complication or long-term problems, but he actually beat some odds,” neonatologist Dr. Taha Ben Saad, who cared for Kendall, explained to “Good Morning America.”

      Jurnakins told “GMA” she feared for her baby’s life at the time. “I just was scared my baby wasn’t gonna make it because they said at that small, he probably wasn’t gonna make it,” she recalled.
